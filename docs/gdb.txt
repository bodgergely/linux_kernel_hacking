use the apropos lx

Lots of useful gdb scripts, function etc defined for the kernel

functions can be called like: $kernel_func("data")

p $lx_per_cpu("tick_cpu_sched")     -> this will grab the PER CPU variable tick_cpu_sched
                                        which is of type struct tick_sched

                                    See the DEFINE_PER_CPU macros in the source for per cpu data

p $lx_current().comm    -> prints the task name
