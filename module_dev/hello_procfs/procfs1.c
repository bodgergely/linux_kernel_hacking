/* Put data into the proc fs file.
*
* Arguments
* =========
* 1. The buffer where the data is to be inserted, if
*
 you decide to use it.
* 2. A pointer to a pointer to characters. This is
*
 useful if you don't want to use the buffer
*
 allocated by the kernel.
* 3. The current position in the file
* 4. The size of the buffer in the first argument.
* 5. Write a "1" here to indicate EOF.
* 6. A pointer to data (useful in case one common
*
 read for multiple /proc/... entries)
*
* Usage and Return Value
* ======================
* A return value of zero means you have no further
* information at this time (end of file). A negative
* return value is an error condition.
*
* For More Information
* ====================
* The way I discovered what to do with this function
* wasn't by reading documentation, but by reading the
* code which used it. I just looked to see what uses
* the get_info field of proc_dir_entry struct (I used a
* combination of find and grep, if you're interested),
* and I saw that it is used in <kernel source
* directory>/fs/proc/array.c.
*
* If something is unknown about the kernel, this is
* usually the way to go. In Linux we have the great
* advantage of having the kernel source code for
* free âˆ’ use it.
